## Overview
This was the only proper cryptography challenge in the finals, eventhough it was under the Incidence Response category. Does not mean it was difficult tho. It was
fairly easy to solve. Quite surprising(or depressing?) that it had only 1 solve. 

## The challenge
We are given an encrypted file `secretProject.txt.encrypted` and the code used for encryption `MySuperEncryptor.py`. We are also told that the plaintext was `1954`
characters long. Then encryptor is as follows:
```python
import argparse
import random
from Crypto.Cipher import AES
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad


header = '''

  __  __         ____                          _____                             _             
 |  \/  |_   _  / ___| _   _ _ __   ___ _ __  | ____|_ __   ___ _ __ _   _ _ __ | |_ ___  _ __

parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Encrypt a file.')
parser.add_argument('-i', '--input', help='Input file name')

if not args.input:
    print('Please provide the input file name using -i or --input.')
    exit()

def encrypt_file(file_path):
    try:
        # Encryption stage 1
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            plaintext = file.read()
        print(len(plaintext))

        ciphertext1 = b''
        for byte in plaintext:
            encrypted_byte = ((ord(byte) ^ random.randint(1, 100))+3)# XOR each byte with the random number
            ciphertext1 += bytes([encrypted_byte])
            nextRand = random.randint(1,100)*55 //255
        
        # Encryption stage 2
        # Generate a random initialization vector (IV)
        iv = random.randbytes(AES.block_size)
        key = random.getrandbits(128)
        print(iv)
        print(key)

        cipher = AES.new(key.to_bytes(16, 'big'), AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
        ciphertext2 = cipher.encrypt(pad(ciphertext1, AES.block_size))

        encrypted_file_path = file_path + '.encrypted'


        with open(encrypted_file_path, 'wb') as file:
            file.write(ciphertext2)

        with open("Message_for_you.txt", 'w') as file:
            file.writelines("I have encrypted your files, and in order to regain access to them, you must make a payment of $500 in Bitcoin within 15-days.\nThe Bitcoin address for the payment is 0xf23BaCC03b790bC6fCA46D0FF738Ec2e8819875F\nAdditionally, send me an email with your payment proof  to nanoshade@tutanota.com ")
        
        

        print('File encrypted successfully.')
        print(f'Encrypted file: {encrypted_file_path}')

    except FileNotFoundError:
        print(f'Error: File not found at {file_path}')

```

## Understanding the encryption process
### Generating ciphertext1
* XOR each character with a random byte and add 3 to it.
* Generate another random number with a weird formula.
### Generating ciphertex2
* Randomly generate the iv and key for AES encryption.
* Encrypt ciphertext1 using AES CBC to get ciphertext2.
## Understanding the point of exploitation
The only vulnerability in this code is that the `seed` is given. Random numbers are generated using a seed. If I use the same seed, I will always get the 
same random values. That is, any sort of randomness is lost. 

What it denotes is using the given seed would give us the exact same values used to encrypt the original file.

## Working out the decryption process
We have to decrypt the `ciphertext2` first since that is what we get from `secretProject.txt.encrypted`. In order to do that, since it is an AES encryption,
we need to get the iv and the key. How to do that?
* do `x = random.randint(1, 100)`
* do `nextRand = random.randint(1,100)*55 //255`
* repeat the above steps 1954 times, as that is the length of the plaintext, and so during the encryption process, those 2 steps ran 1954 times as well.
* In case you are wondering why we have to replicate the exact same steps, if we miss a step then we can't get the actual sequence of random numbers, hence, the decryption would be flawed.
* Remember to store each `x` from the first step in an array(let's call that array `xor_keys`). We will need them later to decrypt `ciphertext1`.

Now we can generate the exact iv, key using
```python
iv = random.randbytes(AES.block_size)
key = random.getrandbits(128)
```
We get ciphertext1 by decrypting ciphertext2. One more step and we can get the flag. How to decrypt ciphertext1?

For each character `i` in ciphertext1:
* Subtract 3 from `ciphertext1[i]`.
* XOR it with `xor_keys[i]`.
  
We get a huge plaintext, and the flag at the end.

## Solution script
```python
'''
*The seed is already given
*We can generate all the random numbers using that seed
*We generate the random bytes used for XOR and store them in an array, which we will use later
*Then we generate the AES iv and key, and decrypt ciphertex2 using them(and also unpad it) to get ciphertext1
*Then we decrypt the ciphertext1 using already generated XOR bytes to get the plaintext
